## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Install all dependencies** (both frontend and backend):
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

   Or install separately:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Application

**Option 1: Run both servers concurrently (Recommended)**
```bash
npm start
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend dev server on `http://localhost:3000`

**Option 2: Run servers separately**

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
npm run server:dev
```

## 🆓 Why Open-Meteo?

Open-Meteo is a free, open-source weather API that:

- Has **NO rate limits** for reasonable use
- Provides **high-quality, accurate data** from national weather services
- Is **completely free** for non-commercial use
- Offers **fast response times**

## 🛠️ Development

### Scripts

- `npm start` - Run both frontend and backend concurrently
- `npm run dev` - Run frontend only (Vite dev server)
- `npm run server:dev` - Run backend only (with hot reload)
- `npm run build` - Build frontend for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run install:all` - Install all dependencies

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch weather data"
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 3001
- Check that the frontend `.env` file has the correct `VITE_API_URL`

### Port already in use
- Frontend (3000): Change in `vite.config.ts`
- Backend (3001): Change in `server/index.js` or set `PORT` environment variable

### CORS errors
- Make sure CORS is enabled in the backend (already configured)
- Check that the API URL in frontend matches the backend URL
