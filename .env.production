# Production Environment Variables
# Used when deployed to Vercel

# The API URL is automatically handled by the app:
# - In production: Uses relative /api path (Vercel serverless functions)
# - In development: Uses http://localhost:3001/api (local Express server)

# You can override the API URL if needed:
# VITE_API_URL=/api
